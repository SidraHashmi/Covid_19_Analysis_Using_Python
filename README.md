# The Outbreak of Covid-19

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my Covid-19 project repository, "The Outbreak of Covid-19"! Here, I've dived headfirst into the world of Covid-19 data from January 22, 2020, to July 27, 2020. Armed with Python and some handy libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly, I've been on a mission to unravel the story behind the pandemic.

So, how did it all start? Well, my course instructor provided some clean datasets, which saved me a ton of time on cleaning up messy data. Shoutout to them for that! With the data in hand, I started asking some big questions, like which countries got hit the hardest and how things changed over time.

I've used a bunch of cool charts and graphs to show the trends, from the classic line graphs to funky pie charts. And yeah, I've stuck with a dark mode theme for all the visuals to really drive home the seriousness of the situation.

This project isn't just about pretty graphs, though. It's been a journey of understanding the data, from digging into the numbers to finding meaningful insights. And hey, if you're into the nitty-gritty details of data analysis, you'll find plenty of that here too!

"The Outbreak of Covid-19" isn't just another data project. It's my way of trying to make sense of this crazy time we're living in. So take a look around, and let's see what we can learn together!

Note: While GitHub may not display all visualizations properly, snapshots of the graphs and plots generated during the analysis have been published on my LinkedIn profile. You can find them [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7162356370384564224/)
